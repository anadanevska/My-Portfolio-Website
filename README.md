## Introduction

This project began as a way for me to learn and grow as a developer. While I followed a [YouTube tutorial by Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YFrGy_mzjY), I have adapted and modified the code to better suit my needs and vision. The tutorial provided a fantastic foundation, but I've added my own touches to enhance functionality and aesthetics. Moving forward, I plan to implement more of my own design ideas and unique features to make this project truly my own. It still needs a little bit of fixing and adding on as well. This is just my first verion!

## Features

- **Original Tutorial Features:** Leveraged the foundational aspects provided in the tutorial.
- **Customized Modifications:** Tailored the project to meet specific needs and preferences.
- **Future Enhancements:** Plans to incorporate unique design elements and additional functionality.
